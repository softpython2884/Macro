/**
 * @fileoverview Manages gamepad input and maps it to keyboard events for navigation.
 */

// This file is now deprecated in favor of the external `key_listener.py` script,
// which provides more reliable system-level input handling.
// The browser-based Gamepad API proved to be inconsistent for robust UI navigation.

// The navigation logic is now handled by the `useGridNavigation` hook, which responds
// to standard keyboard events. The external script can be used to map controller
// inputs to these keyboard events if desired, but the core app logic remains decoupled.

// This file is kept for historical purposes but is no longer used in the application.
// You may safely delete it.
